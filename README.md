# HOPE

A gamified libre image of an O.S. designed for empowerment and articulation of young girls.

Globally, women have disconnected from their female nature. We have forgotten how it feels to collaborate and work peacefully among us. 

This project's main objective is to create sustainable peace on Earth by creating a female sympathy chain. If selected, we will create, distribute and monitor HOPE, the fist gamified libre image of an O.S. (Operating System) designed for empowerment and articulation of young girls around the care of their nature, bodies and spirits.

Technically, HOPE will be distributed as a USB Key (tangible product) and will be the result of an stable Libre - Free software image blended into a first person narrative game that challenges players in the discovery of both ancestral and modern tools and resources.

HOPE shall take young girls (and their sisters, mothers and grandmothers) into a challenging and magical quest of collaboration through the many paths towards a more peaceful and verdant planet.
